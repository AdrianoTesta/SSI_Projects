# Intensity frontier projects

There are three projects based on image/graph analysis.

1. `IF-Image-Classifier` for classifying the type of a particle in an image (image classification)
2. `IF-Image-Segmentation` for classifying the type of a particle at the pixel level in an image (image segmentation)
3. `IF-Graph-Clustering` for a graph node/edge analysis

Each notebook include brief descriptions about the dataset and the challenges.
